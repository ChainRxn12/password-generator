### Project Overview

The scope of this application was to build a random password generator powered by JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML and CSS.

The password generator allows the user to create a strong, secure, and customizable password based on randomizing the following criteria:
1. A length between 8 and 128 characters
2. Lower case letters
3. Upper case letters
4. Numbers between 0 and 9
5. Special Characters

Following through a series of prompts, the password generator will return a unique password that can then be saved to the the individuals local clipboard.
